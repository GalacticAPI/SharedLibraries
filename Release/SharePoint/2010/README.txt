You'll need to download the Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Client Object Model Redistributable and place Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll and Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll here.

They are currently (1/27/2015) available for download here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21786

This is only required if you wish to use the Galactic.SharePoint class library.
