You'll need to download the Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC) for Windows and place Oracle.DataAccess.Dll here.

They are currently (1/27/2015) available for download here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/downloads/net-downloads-160392.html?ssSourceSiteId=ocomen

This is only required if you wish to use the Galactic.Sql.Oracle class library.
