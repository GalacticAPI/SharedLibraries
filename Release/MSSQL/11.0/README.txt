You'll need to download the Microsoft SQL Server Management Objects and place Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll, Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Sfc.dll, and Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll here.

They are currently (1/27/2015) distributed as part of the Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Feature Pack available for download here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29065
(They are also often installed with SQL Server, so you may already have them.)

This is only required if you wish to use the Galactic.Sql.MSSql class library.
